  Entitle bundle is a set of entitlements that can be requested, approved, or revoked by users in a single action, and set in a policy by the admin. Each entitlement can provide the user with access to a resource, which can be as fine-grained as a MongoDB table for example, usually by the use of a “Role”. Thus, one can think of a bundle as a cross-application super role.

# entitle_bundle (Resource)

Entitle bundle is a set of entitlements that can be requested, approved, or revoked by users in a single action, and set in a policy by the admin. Each entitlement can provide the user with access to a resource, which can be as fine-grained as a MongoDB table for example, usually by the use of a “Role”. Thus, one can think of a bundle as a cross-application super role.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "entitle_bundle" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  category    = "terraform"
  description = "terraform"
  tags        = ["terraform"]
  workflow = {
    id = "7d080bfa-9143-11ee-b9d1-0242ac120002"
  }
  roles = [{
    id = "7d080bfa-9143-11ee-b9d1-0242ac120003"
  }]
  allowed_durations = [3600]
}
```
